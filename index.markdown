Welcome,

<img style="float: right;" src="Photo.jpg" width="40%" height="40%">

I hold a PhD in Demography from the University of California, Berkeley. As of September 2024, I am an Economic Researcher at Banco de MÃ©xico (Central Bank of Mexico), spefically in the Directorate General of Economic Research.

My research focuses on Mexican emigration, primarily to the U.S., and how migrant characteristics have changed during this century. 


My dissertation explores the available data to study Mexican migration and focuses on differences by gender and by intentions to migrate.  Specifically, I show how the Mexican Labor Force Survey (ENOE) is a useful source to understand timely change in migration (in and out) in Mexico, since it complements existing statistics from the Mexican Census and other household surveys.
My second chapter adds to the literature on intentions to migrate by focusing on how preparing to migrate may be indicative of future migration.
Finally, third chapter discusses how migrant selection has changed between 2005-2020 and how an important component is gender, specifically in the discussion of feminization of migration.
